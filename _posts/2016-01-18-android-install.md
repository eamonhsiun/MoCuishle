# Mozilla browser

First you have to install a *Mozilla* browser. Grab it from *Google Play*, or 
from the *Mozilla* [archive](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mobile/releases/). 

# Android APK, containing the Add-on

To install *Mo Cuishle* binary preview it's neccessary to enable *Unknown 
sources*. This option is in *Settings* under *Security* on your phone. After 
this it's possible to install the APK by open it in browser or a file manager.

The *Mo Cuishle* app starts with a simple settings activity. You have to enable 
the Proxy with the first setting. A notification icon "MC" is displayed while 
running the service in background. 

*Mo Cuishle* consists of an app and a *Mozilla* add-on separated since *Android* 
has it's *Dalvik* runtime. The *Mozilla* add-on can't spawn a *Java* process so 
the *Mo Cuishle* service has to be up and running always. 

The second setting displays a list of the installed *Mozilla* browsers. 
Selecting one tries to install the add-on onto. That's simple! 

# Complications

Please enable unsigned add-ons regarding 
[Mozilla Install]({{ site.url }}/mozilla-install/#complication-first-time-only) 
first.

Sometimes I've seen the browser showing the file URL but not installing the 
add-on. In this case you can modify the URL to open the directory 
`.../MoCuishle/browser-extension/` in the browser. Then click on *mocuishle.xpi* 
directly to start the installation. 

Don't use the *Mozilla* download with *Android*. It contains *Java* classes and 
*SQLite* binaries you never need on your phone, and more important the path of 
*Mo Cuishle* on your device is probably wrong, so the certificate will not be 
installed. This causes HTTPS to fail.
